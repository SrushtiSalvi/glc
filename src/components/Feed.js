              The Placement Committee of Government Law College is one of the
              most important Committees of the College, shouldering the
              responsibility of providing a stepping stone to success to budding
              lawyers graduating from the College.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Committee aims at exhausting all possible opportunities of
              recruitment with law firms, counsels, LPOs and corporate houses.
              It acts as a link between the recruiters and the students, thereby
              fulfilling the needs of both, and enabling the students to get
              placements on campus. The members of the Placement Committee
              strive hard to ensure that maximum students from the college get
              placements, thus providing them with an opportunity to showcase
              their skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Annual On-Campus Recruitment Program 2012-2013 was a grand
              success, as the Placement Committee, true to its motto, succeeded
              in having more than 60 top law firms, counsel and corporate houses
              recruit our students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since last year, the Placement Committee has been implementing the
              recruitment process throughout the year, thus functioning all year
              through. This academic year, apart from assisting in the
              recruitment process throughout the year, the Committee came up
              with two“PlacementWeeks”, one successfully conducted in
              September/October 2012 and the second scheduled in February 2013.
              This widening of the scope of the activities of the Committee is
              sure to benefit both the students and the potential employers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The participation of a large number of students, lawyers,
              solicitors, law firms and corporate houses was a source of
              inspiration for all students who work zealously for the Committee,
              and will encourage them to undertake the Recruitment Program of
              the current academic year with even greater zeal and enthusiasm.
